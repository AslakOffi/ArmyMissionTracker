- `main.go` is the main file containing the application logic.
- The `static/` directory contains static files such as CSS style sheets.
- The `templates/` directory contains HTML templates used to generate web pages.
- `report_form.html` is the HTML template for the report form.
- `reports.html` is the HTML template for the generated reports list.
- The `reports/generated_reports/` directory is the location where JSON reports generated by the application are stored. This directory is created automatically when you generate your first report.

Make sure to add the `reports/generated_reports/` directory to your `.gitignore` file to avoid tracking the generated reports in your Git repository.
